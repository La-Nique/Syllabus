## Course Description

This course is intended to be an introductory survey on the fundamental concepts and principles that underlie current and emerging methods, tools, and techniques for the efficient engineering of high-quality software systems. This may include the understanding and appreciation of problems in large-scale software development such as functional analysis of information processing systems, system design concepts, timing estimates, documentation and system testing. 

Software Engineering (SE) is concerned with all facets of software development, from the early stages of requirements engineering to maintaining the system after it has been deployed. This includes technical processes of software development as well as activities such as software project management and the development of tools, methods, and theories to support software development. This course is not a "programming" course per se, instead, it focuses on surveying some of the critical facets of SE that may be less familiar to students of computer science, such as identifying a development process appropriate to the circumstances, eliciting and documenting requirements, using reviews and inspections plus machine-based testing in software development, understanding software evolution in large, complex systems, issues associated with developing dependable software systems, and configuration management of large systems developed by multiple engineers.

## Outline and Schedule of Course Topics

The following topics will be covered in the given order. Please note that this schedule is tentative and is meant to serve only as a guide. "Handouts" means that notes and/or readings will be given in class. Although there are fourteen class meeting weeks, one week has been reserved for a midterm and final exam review.

## Homework

Homework will be assigned after each chapter read. It may include questions at the end of the chapter and/or short coding assignments depending on the material. 

### Notes

- **Deadlines** and **due dates** for assignments will be assigned in class.
- **Late assignments will be penalized.**
- No extensions will be given for extra credit assignments.

## Quizzes

Quizzes will also be given after each chapter read. Quiz deadlines will be given in class. No make-ups will be given for quizzes.

## Exams

Test make-ups will be given if and only if:

- the request is made sufficiently in advance of the test, and
- the make-up is scheduled prior to the next class.

## Attendance

Attendance is expected for *each and every class* meeting. Each student is allowed five (5) absences for any reason except on days when there are presentations or exams. Absences exceeding the allowance or absence on a presentation day for any reason results in a 0.2% deduction from the attendance grade.

## Academic Violations

Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism, cheating
on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and
official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual
honesty. The college is committed to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic
Integrity and will pursue cases of academic dishonesty according to the Hunter
College Academic Integrity Procedures. Special attention is given to CONTRACT
CHEATING (this is where students have work completed on their behalf which is
then submitted for academic credit).

## Discussion and Q&A

This term we will be using [Piazza](http://piazza.com/hunter.cuny) for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates and myself. Rather than emailing questions to me, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, please [email them](mailto:team@piazza.com).

Find our class page [here](http://piazza.com/hunter.cuny/spring2017/csci40500/home).

## Email

Emails to the instructor must be via a CUNY email addresses for FERPA reasons. Please post all class-related discussion on Piazza. Also, please ensure that your *correct* email address is entered into the CUNY Blackboard.

## Computer Science Facilities & Labs 

All computer science students can use any of the general-purpose labs throughout Hunter College. In addition, computer science majors and students enrolled in CSCI courses can an obtain an account on the Computer Science Department Network. More information can be found on the [Computer Science Department's website](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/csci/about-cs/computer-science-facilities-labs).

## Counseling & Wellness Services

Counseling & Wellness Services (CWS) provides mental health, health and wellness services aimed at enhancing students' quality of life and maximizing personal and academic growth and development. More information can be found on the [Counseling & Wellness Services website](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/studentservices/counseling-and-wellness).

## Special Needs

Students with special needs should see me for accommodation.

## ADA Compliance

## Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) 

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34
CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education
records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable
program of the U.S. Department of Education.

FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children's education
records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of
18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. Students to whom the
rights have transferred are "eligible students."

- Parents or eligible students have the right to inspect and review the
  student's education records maintained by the school. Schools are not
  required to provide copies of records unless, for reasons such as great
  distance, it is impossible for parents or eligible students to review the
  records. Schools may charge a fee for copies.
- Parents or eligible students have the right to request that a school correct
  records which they believe to be inaccurate or misleading. If the school
  decides not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student then has the
  right to a formal hearing. After the hearing, if the school still decides not
  to amend the record, the parent or eligible student has the right to place a
  statement with the record setting forth his or her view about the contested
  information.
- Generally, schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible
  student in order to release any information from a student's education
  record. However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without
  consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions (34 CFR §
  99.31):
    - School officials with legitimate educational interest;
    - Other schools to which a student is transferring;
    - Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes;
    - Appropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student;
    - Organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school;
    - Accrediting organizations;
    - To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena; 
    - Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies; and
    - State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant
      to specific State law.

Schools may disclose, without consent, "directory" information such as a
student's name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, honors and
awards, and dates of attendance. However, schools must tell parents and
eligible students about directory information and allow parents and eligible
students a reasonable amount of time to request that the school not disclose
directory information about them. Schools must notify parents and eligible
students annually of their rights under FERPA. The actual means of notification
(special letter, inclusion in a PTA bulletin, student handbook, or newspaper
article) is left to the discretion of each school.
