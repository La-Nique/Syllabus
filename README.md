## Succeeding in this Course

If you want to succeed in this course, do *all* of the following:

- Do the assigned readings *before* the lecture, *not* *after* it.
- Make a list of questions before the class.
- Submit all assignments on time.
- Solve a set of problems at the end of each chapter.
- Study for exams.
- Do all assignments yourself\! Expect severe penalties for plagiarism.

## Organization

### Syllabus and Readings

At the end of this document, you can see which parts of the textbook we will cover. You are responsible for everything in the listed chapters regardless of how much time we spend on them in class. As noted above, you should read ahead so that you can ask questions in class to clear up anything you find confusing.

### Assignments

No one can become proficient at programming without writing many programs. I will assign five assignments during the semester.

Every program must satisfy the programming rules stated in the `rules.html` (posted on Blackboard) document. Please read it very carefully. Rules governing lateness, plagiarism, and how they are graded are also contained there. You are *not* allowed to work in groups. You can discuss about the assignments. However, copying of pieces of code among peers is a serious problem. It is critically important that all submitted program listings and executions be thoroughly documented. Each assignment will count for 12% of your final grade. That means that the five assignments will constitute 60% of your final grade. You are allowed to use the source code that is provided by the book.

All programs must compile and run. Zero credit will be given for programs that do not compile or do not run. The homework assignments will only state the major objectives of the program to be written; it will be often up to you to make design decisions regarding I/O, efficiency, error handling, and so on. Make sure you provide adequate test cases to indicate the correctness and robustness of your approaches.

Each will be assigned in Blackboard along with submission instructions. I have designed this course to be **self-contained**. Thus, **the only resources you need to answer the questions are contained within the course**. Searching the web (e.g., Google) for answers is not only *unnecessary* but also risks [academic violations](#academic-violations), which can result in course failure.

### Notes

- **Deadlines** and **due dates** for assignments will be assigned in class.
- **Late assignments will be penalized.**
- No extensions will be given for extra credit assignments.
- Assignments are the result of **individual effort** unless otherwise noted (e.g., group projects).

### Exams

Test make-ups will be given if and only if:

- the request is made sufficiently in advance of the test, and
- the make-up is scheduled prior to the next class.

## Class Meetings

### Professional Presence

Every student is expected to present themselves in a professional manner. Students with questions or who wish to participate during the lecture are encouraged to raise their hands during class.

### Attendance

Attendance is expected for *each and every class* meeting. The instructor will start the class on time, and students are expected to be present on time.

## Course Material and Communication

All course material (e.g., slides, course documents, announcements, homework) will be posted on *Blackboard*.

### Email

- Emails to the instructor must be via a CUNY Hunter College email addresses for FERPA reasons.
- Include the *class name* or *number* in the *subject* line of the email.
- Email thread *hijacking* is strongly discouraged. Ensure that the subject of your email matches its contents.
- Post all class-related discussions on the *Bb discussion board*. Students are highly encouraged to "subscribe" to the *general* forum to receive email notifications regarding new posts.
- Ensure that your *correct* (CUNY) email address is entered into the CUNY Blackboard.

### Bulletin Board

You should check the [Blackboard](http://bbhosted.cuny.edu) site regularly since all class material will be posted there. Please make sure you have configured Bb to use your *CUNY email address*. You are responsible for any email the instructors might send there.

## Special Needs

Students with special needs should see me for accommodation *at least* two weeks prior to the due date of any assignment or exam.

## Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) 

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.

FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children's education records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. Students to whom the rights have transferred are "eligible students."

- Parents or eligible students have the right to inspect and review the student's education records maintained by the school. Schools are not required to provide copies of records unless, for reasons such as great distance, it is impossible for parents or eligible students to review the records. Schools may charge a fee for copies.
- Parents or eligible students have the right to request that a school correct records which they believe to be inaccurate or misleading. If the school decides not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student then has the right to a formal hearing. After the hearing, if the school still decides not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student has the right to place a statement with the record setting forth his or her view about the contested information.
- Generally, schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any information from a student's education record. However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions (34 CFR § 99.31):
    - School officials with legitimate educational interest;
    - Other schools to which a student is transferring;
    - Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes;
    - Appropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student;
    - Organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school;
    - Accrediting organizations;
    - To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena; 
    - Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies; and
    - State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant to specific State law.

Schools may disclose, without consent, "directory" information such as a student's name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, honors and awards, and dates of attendance. However, schools must tell parents and eligible students about directory information and allow parents and eligible students a reasonable amount of time to request that the school not disclose directory information about them. Schools must notify parents and eligible students annually of their rights under FERPA. The actual means of notification (special letter, inclusion in a PTA bulletin, student handbook, or newspaper article) is left to the discretion of each school.

For additional information, you may call 1-800-USA-LEARN (1-800-872-5327) (voice). Individuals who use TDD may use the Federal Relay Service.
